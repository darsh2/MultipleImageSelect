#MultipleImageSelect
An android library that allows selection of multiple images from gallery. It shows an initial
album (buckets) chooser and then images in selected album. Can limit the number of images that
can be selected. Can be used in apps with APK 11 onwards.

Sample app can be found [here](https://github.com/darsh2/MultipleImageSelect/tree/master/sample) 
#Usage
Include this library in your project using gradle (thanks to [JitPack.io](https://github.com/jitpack-io)).
```gradle
repositories {
  maven {
    url "https://jitpack.io"
  }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.darsh2:MultipleImageSelect:v0.0.1'
}
```
In project's AndroidManifest.xml, add the following under application node:
```xml
<activity
  android:name="com.darsh.multipleimageselect.activities.AlbumSelectActivity"
  android:theme="@style/MultipleImageSelectTheme">
  <intent-filter>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```
   In the activity from where you want to call image selector, create Intent as follows:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(this, AlbumSelectActivity.class);
//set limit on number of images that can be selected, default is 10
intent.putExtra(Constants.INTENT_EXTRA_LIMIT, numberOfImagesToSelect);
startActivityForResult(intent, Constants.REQUEST_CODE);
```
   and override onActivityResult as follows:
```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  if (requestCode == Constants.REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == RESULT_OK && data != null) {
    //The array list has the image paths of the selected images
    ArrayList<String> images = data.getStringArrayListExtra(Constants.INTENT_EXTRA_IMAGES);
    ...  
}
```
